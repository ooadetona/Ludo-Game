Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

 1. Introduction

 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for a Two-Dice Ludo Game to be implemented using Python. The game will follow the traditional Ludo board game rules with modifications to incorporate two dice.

 1.2 Document Conventions
- Shall denotes a mandatory requirement.
- Should denotes a recommended feature.
- May denotes an optional feature.

 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for developers, testers, and project stakeholders involved in the development of the Two-Dice Ludo Game.

 1.4 Project Scope
The Two-Dice Ludo Game will be a digital board game supporting 2 to 4 players. Players will roll two six-sided dice to move their tokens and follow the game rules until a winner emerges. The application will include:
- Single-player (AI opponents) and Multiplayer (local & online)
- Game state persistence
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Customizable house rules

 2. Overall Description

 2.1 Product Perspective
The software will be a standalone Python application with GUI support using Tkinter or Pygame.

 2.2 Product Functions
- Game Initialization: Players select names, colors, and number of tokens.
- Dice Roll Mechanics: Players roll two six-sided dice.
- Token Movement: Players can split dice results between multiple tokens.
- Capture Mechanism: Opponent tokens can be sent back to the base.
- Winning Conditions: The first player to bring all tokens to the home wins.
- Game Persistence: Save and resume functionality.

 2.3 User Characteristics
Users may range from casual gamers to Ludo enthusiasts. The interface will be user-friendly, requiring minimal learning time.

 2.4 Constraints
- The game shall be developed using Python 3.x.
- The GUI shall be built using Tkinter or Pygame.
- The game shall support local and online play.
- The maximum number of players shall be 4.

 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have Python installed if running the script directly.
- Network connectivity is required for online multiplayer.

 3. Specific Requirements

 3.1 Functional Requirements
 3.1.1 Game Setup
- The system shall allow players to choose 2, 3, or 4 players.

- Usability: The UI shall be intuitive for new players.
- Portability: The system shall run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Security: The online mode shall prevent unauthorized game alterations.

 3.3 External Interface Requirements
 3.3.1 User Interfaces
- The system shall provide a Graphical Board UI with interactive elements.

 3.3.2 Hardware Interfaces
- The system shall run on PCs and laptops with basic specifications.

 3.3.3 Software Interfaces
- The system shall use SQLite or JSON for saving game states.
- The system shall use sockets or WebSockets for online play.

 4. Appendices
- Appendix A: Ludo board layout and movement rules.
- Appendix B: GUI wireframes (if available).
- Appendix C: House rule variations for customization.
